                Tesla’s goal for their company, specifically towards their cars, is “to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.” The Tesla  Model S is the company’s leading car to represent their goal of making an electric, sustainable car future as it is a 100% electric fueled that according to Tesla has a range of 600km (meaning it can run without charge for 600km Not only is the car a non-polluter, the materials that make up the Model S is reused. When the life cycle is complete, the car is stamped together and the metal of it would be reused as metal parts for other cars. Additionally, 30% of used Lithium-ion batteries are turned into slag(stony waste matter extracted from metal) which is then sold to metal manufacturers and cement manufacturers. By doing so, they are essentially reducing their lithium battery waste by 30% which then means their CO2 emissions are reduced by that amount as well.
